autocomplete-co.-suggest
========================

improved jquery autocomplete for company search &amp; suggestion among  tables

The script aims to help user to search for a company using different information from the company.

The companies have long or similar names and sometimes it is difficult to remember. The project is to write down a code
to suggest company by typing a phone number,an email, an employee name/surname, city, part of company name.
All the input will be entered from the same inbox, so the user can find the company easily if he/she know some 
data about the company.

Unique data:  Phone Number
              Email
              Tax Number
              
Other daha:   Full or partial company name
              City
              Employee name/surname
